🧠 Notes

Codex (@codex-ai) should be added to your repo collaborators list if not already.

Jules (@jules-dev) should also be added as a collaborator or team member.

GitHub will automatically request reviews from these accounts when files in their areas change.

You can refine these ownerships later if, for example, Jules focuses exclusively on testing or UI.
