Prompt Template (Manual version in book)

Goal: Summarize any client meeting into a 1-page report

Prompt:
“You are my virtual project assistant. Summarize the following meeting notes into clear action items, decisions, and next steps. Use bullet points.”

[Paste notes here]

→ In the SaaS, this becomes a prefilled “Meeting Summary” module.
