implement displayName and improve signout redirect\n\nThis commit introduces several new features and improvements to the authentication system:\n\n- **Signout Redirect:** The signout buttons in both the desktop and mobile navigation bars have been updated to use the `signOut` function from `next-auth/react` with a `callbackUrl` of `/login`. This ensures that users are always redirected to the login page after signing out.\n- **DisplayName on Signup:** The signup page now includes a \"Display Name\" field. This value is saved to the database when a new user is created.\n- **DisplayName on Dashboard:** The dashboard now displays the user's `DisplayName` in the welcome message, falling back to their email if the `DisplayName` is not set.\n\nThese changes improve the user experience and provide more personalization options.","tree":{"sha":"c623c7caacd5693335dda513829075808d1af89a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/garybayes/saas-app/git/trees/c623c7caacd5693335dda513829075808d1af89a"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/garybayes/saas-app/git/commits/bc39004889c56be7bf6e9dc8e32f2e5c99de4fc7","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null,"verified_at":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/garybayes/saas-app/commits/bc39004889c56be7bf6e9dc8e32f2e5c99de4fc7","html_url":"https://github.com/garybayes/saas-app/commit/bc39004889c56be7bf6e9dc8e32f2e5c99de4fc7","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/garybayes/saas-app/commits/bc39004889c56be7bf6e9dc8e32f2e5c99de4fc7/comments","author":{"login":"google-labs-jules[bot]","id":161369871,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOCZ5PDw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/842251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/google-labs-jules","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"google-labs-jules[bot]","id":161369871,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOCZ5PDw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/842251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/google-labs-jules","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/google-labs-jules%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"ba44086c595238037c6c979c1485be1133caf342","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/garybayes/saas-app/commits/ba44086c595238037c6c979c1485be1133caf342","html_url":"https://github.com/garybayes/saas-app/commit/ba44086c595238037c6c979c1485be1133caf342"}]},{"sha":"ba44086c595238037c6c979c1485be1133caf342","node_id":"C_kwDOQCqLKtoAKGJhNDQwODZjNTk1MjM4MDM3YzZjOTc5YzE0ODViZTExMzNjYWYzNDI","commit":{"author":{"name":"google-labs-jules[bot]","email":"161369871+google-labs-jules[bot]@users.noreply.github.com","date":"2025-11-03T01:03:38Z"},"committer":{"name":"google-labs-jules[bot]","email":"161369871+google-labs-jules[bot]@users.noreply.github.com","date":"2025-11-03T01:03:38Z"},"message":"fix(middleware): implement robust redirect logic for all auth states\n\nThis commit resolves multiple redirect issues, including a redirect loop for unauthenticated users and inconsistent behavior for authenticated users.\n\nThe new middleware in `src/middleware.ts` uses a \"public pages\" pattern to explicitly define routes that are accessible to unauthenticated users (`/login`, `/signup`).\n\nThe logic is now as follows:\n- If a user is authenticated and tries to access a public page, they are redirected to `/connections`.\n- If a user is not authenticated and tries to access any non-public page, they are redirected to `/login`.\n\nThis is combined with restoring the `pages: { signIn: '/login' }` configuration in the `next-auth` options, which prevents `next-auth` from defaulting to its own sign-in page and causing conflicts.
